# Revision of C++ Concepts and Data Structures

Welcome to the **C++ Concepts and Data Structures** repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of essential concepts and topics for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++. It serves as a valuable resource for revising fundamental programming techniques and implementing various data structures and algorithms.

## 📚 Topics Covered

Below is the list of topics that will be included in this repository upon completing the course:

### 1. **C/C++ Fundamentals**
   - **Revision of Concepts**: Key programming fundamentals such as syntax, variables, data types, operators, and more.
   - **Decision-Making Statements**: `if`, `else`, `switch` statements, and their applications.
   - **Loops**: `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for iterative control flow.
   - **Functions**: Defining and invoking functions, pass-by-value and reference, recursion.
   - **Class & Object**: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes, objects, and constructors.

---

### 2. **Arrays and Structures**
   - **Array Basics**: Declaration, initialization, and manipulation of arrays.
   - **Structures**: Creating and using structures to store complex data types.
   - **Polynomial Representation**:
     - Representation of single-variable polynomials using arrays.
     - Polynomials as an array of structures.
     - Operations on polynomials, including polynomial addition.

---

### 3. **Searching and Sorting Techniques**
   - **Need for Searching**: Why searching algorithms are essential.
   - **Searching Techniques**: Linear Search, Binary Search, and their comparisons.
   - **Sorting Techniques**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.

---

### 4. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**
   - Understanding dynamic memory allocation (`new`, `delete`) in C++.
   - Working with dynamically allocated arrays and structures.

---

### 5. **Linked List**
   - **Introduction to Linked Lists**: What is a linked list and why it's useful.
   - **Types of Linked Lists**:
     - Singly Linked List
     - Doubly Linked List
     - Circular Linked List
   - **Operations**:
     - Insertion
     - Deletion
     - Traversal
     - Searching
   - **Applications of Linked Lists**.

---

### 6. **Stack**
   - **Introduction to Stacks**: Definition and use cases.
   - **Applications of Stacks**:
     - Expression Conversion (Infix to Postfix/Prefix).
     - Expression Evaluation.
   - **Stack Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek, and checking for underflow/overflow.

---

### 7. **Queue**
   - **Introduction to Queues**: Definition and real-life applications.
   - **Types of Queues**:
     - Simple Queue
     - Circular Queue
     - Priority Queue
   - **Queue Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, and Peek.

---

### 8. **Tree as a Non-Linear Data Structure**
   - **Tree Basics**: Definition, properties, and terminologies (root, node, edge, height, depth, etc.).
   - **Types of Trees**:
     - Binary Tree
     - Binary Search Tree (BST)
     - AVL Tree
     - Heap
   - **Tree Implementation**: Representation and traversal (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder).

---

### 9. **Database Management System (DBMS)**
   - Basic concepts of database management.
   - Introduction to relational databases and their applications.
